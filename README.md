# Eurex_Option_Scraper

This Python script scrapes pre-trade options data for Eurex and saves the data into an SQLite database.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required packages:
    ```
    pip install requests
    ```
3. Update the following variables in `scrape.py` to your needs:
    ```python
    exchanges = ['DEUR']
    date = '2023.04.18'
    begin_time = '120000'
    stop_time = '130000'
    ```
4. Run the `scrape.py` script:
    ```
    python scrape.py
    ```
 
The script sets up an SQLite database, downloads data for the specified exchanges, date, and time range, and inserts it into the appropriate tables.
